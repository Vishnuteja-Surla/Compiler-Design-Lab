In this lab, you should be familiarized with the file handling operations by using C programming

Write a C program to 
1. Read from a file: Read the contents of attached file input.txt and print them on the terminal.
2. Write to a file: Read the contents from input.txt and write them to output.txt file
3. Append to a file: with out effecting the contents of output.txt, append some sentences to output.txt

For doing the above operations, who have to explore the syntaxes of following functions in C.
- fopen function with 3 modes (i.e., read, write, append modes).
- fgets function to read the contents from file one line at a time.
- fputs function to write the contents to file.
