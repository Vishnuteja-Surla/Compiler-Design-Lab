# Given a CFG which is LL(1) as an input file where each line has exactly one production rule, Write a C program to compute and print the LL(1) parsing table. 

## Note: (Nonterminals -Capital letters, Terminals - small letters).

### Example CFG which is LL(1):
V = S$  
S = aAS  
S = c  
A = ba  
A = SB  
B = bA  
B = S  
Note: starting symbol is V here.
